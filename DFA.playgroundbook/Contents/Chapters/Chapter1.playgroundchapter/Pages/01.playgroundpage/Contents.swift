 # Deterministic Finite Automaton

 A deterministic finite automation (short **DFA**) is a finite-state maschine that accepts or rejects a word.
 Like a *regular expression*, it can be used determine if a string of characters is part of a certain *regular language*.
 Although a DFA is an abstract concept from the theory of computation,
 it is often used to to check if an email address is valid or if a number was entered in the correct format.

 ### Checking numbers

 The example on the right shows the formal definition of a DFA, that accepts a decimal number with two decimal digits (like 12.53).

 Let's test if the automaton works blow:

 Enter a value and hit "Run My Code"!

let s1 = State(isStart: true, name: "q1")
let s2 = State(name: "q2")

let s4 = State(name: "q4")
let s5 = State(isAcceptedEnd: true, name: "q5")

let automaton = try DFA(alphabete: numbers + ["."],
