# Deterministic Finite Automaton

A [Deterministic Finite Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) (short DFA) is a finite state machine, that checks if a string of characters follows certain rules. It's bascally another way to represent a [Regular Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), but just have a look at the *Swift Playground Book* if you want to learn more.
